    <p>Tiramisu is part of a research study conducted by the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Accessible Public Transportation (www.rercapt.org) at Carnegie Mellon University. The purpose of the research is to investigate the design and development of an accessible, social-computing software system that allows users of public transportation to receive arrival information and participate in a dialog about public transit.</p>

    <p>Tiramisu will show you information about when buses are expected to arrive. It will collect your location information and your movement information. Location information is used to help provide information relevant to your current location. Movement information is used to infer when you have boarded or disembarked from a transit vehicle.</p>

    <p>You may have the ability to generate and comment messages describing your experience with the transit service. To create a message, you must first create a user account that includes your name, email address, and neighborhood. You may be able to use Facebook or Google logins to avoid creating a separate account. If you use a social media account to connect, we will collect your name, email, and city location. When you create or comment on a message, your name and neighborhood may be attached to the message. These messages will be viewable by all users of the Tiramisu system and may be available publically through services such as Facebook and Twitter. </p>

    <p>Participation in this research is limited to individuals age 13 years and older.</p>

    <p><b>Risks:</b> The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this research are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during other online activities. No personal data will be collected from the phones. We will be keeping the GPS location data for your rides. It will be stored based on your phone ID number and not based on your phone number, name, or other personally identifiable information.</p>

    <p>The real-time data provided by this software is an estimate and you accept the risk that this data may be incorrect or misleading. Using the app will cause your phone to use more battery power than if you had not used the app.</p>

    <p><b>Benefits & Costs:</b> There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the research but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity. You may find your commute experience is improved because of the arrival information for the buses. There is no compensation or costs to you for participation in this research. </p>

    <p><b>Confidentiality:</b> By participating in this research, you understand and agree that Carnegie Mellon may be required to disclose your consent to this research, data and other personally identifiable information as required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order. Otherwise, your confidentiality will be maintained in the following manner:</p>

However, your phone ID number and other direct personal identifiers will not be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination of the research data and/or results by Carnegie Mellon.</p>

    <p>The researchers will take the following steps to protect participantsâ€™ identities during this research: 
      (1) All participant data will be stored based on phone ID number; (2) the researchers will record any data collected during the research by phone ID, not by your name or phone number; and (3) the GPS trace information will be stored on a server in a secure location that is accessible only by authorized researchers on this research team.  </p>
